# PyBer_Analysis
performing pyber ride share analysis with python, pandas,matplotlib using jupyter notebook.

# Overview of the analysis:
This project aims to create a summary data frame of the ride-sharing data by city type, which gives total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and driver. And to create a multiline chart that shows the total weekly fares for each city type by using pandas and matplotlib library.

# Results:
## summary data frame:

In urban city-type total drivers are more than the total rides, resulting in a decrease in average fare per ride and average fare per driver compared to suburban and rural city types.

In rural city types, though the total drivers and total rides are less, they have a high average fare per ride and driver compared to urban and suburban city types.

The total rides are more in an urban city, resulting in the highest total fares than in suburban and rural cities.

## multiple line chart:

looking at the chart, we can see all the three cities are at their peak till the last week of February, though the urban city is oscillating through March and April and it will fall at the end of the week, the suburban and rural city dips at the end of March.

The rural city takes the lead in the first week of April while the suburban fails to rise, but at the end of April, we can see the subtlety in the curve while the rural city drops off at the end of April.

# summary:

Business recommendations to the CEO as follows:

The company can hire more drivers for the rural and suburban cities who are comfortable driving long distances and more comfortable driving in those areas.

The company can invest in advertising campaigns for all city types, especially in urban cities, to increase the total rides or cut down the drivers' size.

The company should increase the cost per ride in the urban city as the urban market is large compared to other cities. A slight increase in cost per ride can help in increasing the average revenue per ride and driver.
